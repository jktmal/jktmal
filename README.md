## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to repository containing personal projects of **Jan Malinowski** *Applied Physics MSc.*  
I plan to uptade this repository with recent projects and interesting results of my research.

Contents of repo:
- [bachelor thesis originally written in English](https://github.com/jktmal/jktmal/blob/main/BSc_thesis_JanMalinowski.pdf)
- master thesis also written in English is going to be uploaded in 5 months (after the priority to publicate for University expires)
- [publication that I co-authored](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346736446_Properties_of_Cavities_in_Biological_Structures-A_Survey_of_the_Protein_Data_Bank)
- [site linked to the aforementioned publication, that I contributed with my code](http://info.ifpan.edu.pl/~chwastyk/spaceball/)
- [note on examining differences between two datasets originating from one common dataset](https://github.com/jktmal/jktmal/blob/main/stat_note.pdf) 
- [project on modeling complex biological systems in R](https://github.com/jktmal/jktmal/tree/main/modelling_of_complex_biological_systems)
- [project applying statistical data analysis in R](https://github.com/jktmal/jktmal/tree/main/statistical_data_analysis)
- [various molecular modeling projects in Python](https://github.com/jktmal/jktmal/tree/main/molecular_modeling)
- [project on statistical physics of complex networks in Python](https://github.com/jktmal/jktmal/tree/main/statistical_physics_of_complex_networks)

This is only tiny fragment of work I've done for last few years, that I've found acceptable to present without putting huge effort to polish.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on few projects regarding various topics from optimalization problems to clusterization of non-trivial data.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mathematical modeling of finance processess.
