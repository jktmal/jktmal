# Statistical analysis regarding optimization of extraction
This project was the part of the consultation, regarding statistical analysis, provided to one of the authors of the following publication:
A.M. Piasek et al., Brewing antioxidants from spent coffee grounds: the optimization of the extraction process and the comparison of aquatic and ethanolic antioxidant extracts (*to be published*)

My work consisted of the two tasks:
1. writing note on statistics method that could be used in the work, explaining it in layman's terms,
2. preparing/cleaning the data and performing statistical tests.
Analysis protocol was described below in details.

## Analysis protocol
Firstly the data was examined with regard to normality of its distributions. Due to the irregular variances, non-parametric tests were chosen instead.
Two-steps approach was applied to minimize the number of tests performed:
1. Kruskal-Wallis H-test - to test if there are any significant differences between multiple groups
2. Mann-Whitney U-test - to test *post hoc* differences between 
All hypotheses

## Results
Finally p-values for the tests were obtained. This allowed to increase the analytical rigor of the study. 

### TBD
- uploading of the python script for the analysis
- supplementing information of non-parametric tests in the note
- uploading example of tests, implemented in spreadsheets
- updating README file
