# Statistical analysis regarding optimization of extraction
This project was the part of the consultation 
A.M. Piasek et al., Brewing antioxidants from spent coffee grounds: the optimization of the extraction process and the comparison of aquatic and ethanolic antioxidant extracts (*to be published*)

## Contents:
- [note explaining the statisticial methods used in the publication](https://github.com/jktmal/jktmal/blob/main/statistical_analysis_of_extraction_optimization/notka_statystyczna.pdf)

## Analysis protocol
Firstly the data was examined in regard to normality. Due to the irregular variances in it, non-parametric tests were chosen.
Two-steps approach was applied to minimize the number of tests performed:
1. Kruskal-Wallis H-test
2. Mann-Whitney U-test 
All hypotheses

## Results
Finally p-values for the tests were obtained.

### TBD
- uploading of the python script for the analysis
- supplementing information of non-parametric tests in the note
- uploading example of tests, implemented in spreadsheets
- updating README file
